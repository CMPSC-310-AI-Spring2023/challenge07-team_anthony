## Plan

In this challenge we are going to create a Tiktok video about AI to show how students view an AI system. The tiktok video will consist of subway surfers in the background with an audio voice recording in the background discussing the how student can use it ethically and how some students use it for non-ethical purposes. Our video will demonstrate examples of different scenarios of how students can use AI in different ways. 

## Script

**Scenario 1 - Student Cheats 

Narrator: Have you ever felt the need to be lazy on an assignment and cheat?

Student 1: I have been dying to finish JJs Lab assignment but I do not want to spend hours completing code!

Narrator: Well AI is here to help you! You can use sources like Chat GPT, Microsoft Co-Pilot, or DALL-E to create your own poster!

Student 1: WOW AMAZING! I am so happy now that I can use these resources to complete my assignments and have time to party this weekend. 

Narrator: AI can be a resource for students to easily grasp answers from the internet and not get caught with plagiarism. AI can sometimes create lazy students and breeze through assignments. (FIX LATER OR SOMETHING)

**Scenario 2: Benefits

Narrator: (INTRODUCE THE DIFFERENT SCENARIO HERE)

Student 2: I do not understand this reading about AI models, someone help meeeeeee! 

Narrator: Dont worry! AI has your back, you can easily summarize specific readings by typing in the Author’s name and Title of the article. Then the AI can give you a brief summary of the reading and help you out!

Or 

Ask the AI to explain what the model is and how it work and it can quickly help you study these concepts.

Student 2: Wow I did not know I could use AI in such an efficient way! I can now study unlike student 1 (FIX LATER OR SOMETHING) 


**Scenario 3 - Ethics (Viewpoints)

Student 3: So I have never used AI before, I want to know if AI is good or bad so I won’t get in trouble by Professor JJ. 

Narrator: Well you can use it for different purposes, students can easily benefit from AI and can quickly study concepts if they utilize it for their advantages. For example, a student can use AI to debug their ORIGINAL code in order to help them resolve their programming issues. This can help many students not stay up until 3 in the morning to complete their homework

Student 3: So you’re saying AI is a good thing? 

Narrator: AI can also be used incorrectly as well. For example, students can also use it to their advantage by making it write their whole essay or giving them answers to test. This also makes it difficult for Professors to penalize students for cheating.

Student 3: Oh wow, I never want to use it for those purposes but I can definitely see how it can be used for cheating. 

Narrator: AI is advancing our knowledge on technology and that plays a major role in creating new technology to access information but can be limited by real-time information which is not always useful in academics. 

Student 3: I will use AI to help me teach new concepts as long as I use it ethnically

**Scenario 4: Ideas for integrating AI into teaching.

Narrator: AI can be used in the classroom by a professor!

Student 4: How can they possibly do that? 

Narrator: It can be an accesible as teachers can implement an interactice TA (teaching assistant) in class. It can also be used to support the professor in making a cirriculum in the classroom. Lastly, it can be used to grade exams or essays and relieve workload on teachers. 

Student 4: That sounds amazing and makes a more adaptable environment to allow professors to incorporate AI in the classroom! I will now let my teacher know about this!
